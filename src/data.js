    lyrics:
      'Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;\nI want Thee forever to live in my soul.\nBreak down every idol, cast out every foe;\nNow wash me, and I shall be \nWhiter than snow.\n \nWhiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow.\nNow wash me, and I shall be \nWhiter than snow.\n \nLord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat,\nI wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet.\nBy faith, for my cleansing, \nI see Thy blood flow,\nNow wash me, and I shall be \nWhiter than snow.\n \nLord Jesus, Thou knowest I patiently wait,\nCome now, and within me a new heart create;\nTo those who have sought Thee, \nThou never saidst "No,"\nNow wash me, and I shall be \nWhiter than snow.',

    title: '133.  WITHOUT HIM',
    lyrics:
      'Without Him, I could do nothing,\nWithout Him, I’d surely fail;\nWithout Him, I would be drifting\nLike a ship without a sail.\n \nJesus, O Jesus,\nDo you know Him today?\nDo not turn Him away.\nO Jesus, O Jesus,\nWithout Him, how lost I would be.\n \nWithout Him, I could be dying,\nWithout Him, I’d be enslaved;\nWithout Him, life would be hopeless,\nBut with Jesus, thank God, I’m saved.',
